      out, I'll give a quick overview of what we mean when we say coevolution and the difficulties surrounding its study. As John
      Thompson points out in the opening chapter of his book", em('The Coevolutionary Process')," (1994), the complex web of interactions
      within and between species was a central concern of Darwin's thinking on the evolution of biodiversity. Darwin's 
      closing paragraph in",em("On the Origin of Species"), "describes the 'tangled bank,' a vision of life as a dense network
      of interacting organisms, all shaping each other's evolution. The evolution of interacting
      species is a complex problem that continues to fascinate evolutionary biologists, and coevolution is an important
      process within the broader field of community evolution. Coevolution is, in some ways, a sort of 'special case'
      of community evolution where two or more species mutually affect each other's evolutionary trajectories. So, for example, predators may
      drive evolution of toxins as a chemical defense in their prey. These defenses then drive evolution of resistance in 
      predators. As predator resistance increases, prey with higher levels of toxin survive better, thus driving toxin levels
      higher in surviving prey populations, which of course then selects for even higher resistance in predators This example, often called a 'coevolutionary arms
      race' is only one example of how interacting species can shape each other's evolutionary trajectories. In this case, we expect
      coevolutionary forces to drive each species' trait to larger and larger values until some limit is reached. This limit may be
      abiotic (by which we mean it doesn't relate to another living species and is instead defined by environmental factors) or 
      biotic (some other species limits how toxic prey can get or how resistant predators can become). Coevolution can
      occur in antagonistic relationships (like the predator prey example), in mutualistic systems (like flowering plants and 
      pollinating insects), in competitive systems (where the interaction is competition between species for a shared resource), and in systems where
      the nature of the relationship may differ from site-to-site (for example, the", em("Greya-Lithophragma")," relationship discussed in
      Nuismer et al. 1999, one of the models you'll find as part of this web app).")),
      
      h3("The Difficulties of Reciprocal Selection and the Geographic Mosaic Model"),
      p(h4("While it is possible for any of the above relationships to represent coevolution, none of these types of interactions
           are inherently coevolutionary. None are inherently reciprocal. Toxic prey may exert selective pressure on predator resistance, but predator resistance
           may not drive toxicity higher (see Benkman et al. 2019, where resistance in garter snakes correlates to prey (newt)
           toxicity, but prey toxicity is best explained by neutral population structure). While the concept of reciprocal 
           selection can be quite simple, disentangling the complex patterns of how traits are distributed in space into clear, discrete evolutionary
           processes is much more difficult. Even in situations where traits (i.e. phenotypes) are highly correlated among
           interacting species and patterns and mechanisms of reciprocal selection line up perfectly, it remains possible
           for non-reciprocal processes to drive trait distributions.")),
      
      #okay, so next part is digging into the geographic mosaic of coevolution - why that's the 
      #prevailing model now, how that leads to "meaningful" patterns in trait distributions (ie
      #patterns that suggest a strong or diffuse coevolutionary pattern) across species ranges,
      #and the ambiguity that arises when we consider alternative hypotheses - shared abiotic
      #optima for traits, "trait remixing" via demographic factors, one species adapting to
      #the other but no reciprocity involved (in conjunction with spatially structured remixing
      #this could create very similar patterns to spatially structured coevolution from a classic
      #mosaic). 
      
      p(h4("This difficulty of interpreting patterns stems from a number of factors inherent to community evolution and more specifically to coevolution.")),
      
      #Next would be why models are useful - "utility of models." These generate explicit 
      #predictions that can be tested against empirical systems. these can range from tests
      #of whether correlated phenotypes are meaningful to how complex trait distributions
      #can arise from reciprocity to how demographic models may generate specific patterns of
      #genetic differentiaton among differently evolving populations.
